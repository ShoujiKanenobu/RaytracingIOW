# RaytracingIOW
Writing a brute force raytracer following Peter Shirley's book.

## Thoughts on the project:
I was shortsighted and didnt save each image that the raytracer produced, but most things rendered were similar to the book aside from a few mistakes/tangents I went on.

I tried for a while to figure out some other interset functions to produce different shapes, but this raytracer doesn't seem to match the architecture of others that I looked at making resources hard to find. In the future I want to try implementing the functions listed here: https://iquilezles.org/articles/intersectors/

I haven't gone through Raytracing The Next Week, yet but other volumes seem to be included, so maybe the answers I'm looking for will be there.
